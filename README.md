## How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I approach designing software by carefully planning modular structures, defining reusable classes, and considering object relationships before implementing code. Through this project, I developed skills in designing systems for 3D rendering, such as managing shaders, textures, and materials in an organized way. My design process involved outlining the scene elements, deciding on appropriate transformations and lighting, and then iteratively refining the structure based on visual and technical requirements. These tactics, including modularity, abstraction, and iterative testing, can be applied to future projects to simplify complex systems, ensure maintainability, and streamline development workflows.
## How do I approach developing programs? What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I approach developing programs by building a functional foundation first and then incrementally adding features while continuously testing for correctness and performance. During this project, I adopted new development strategies such as modularizing code into reusable functions for camera control, scene setup, lighting, and material definitions, which made the program easier to manage and debug. Iteration played a critical role in my development process, as I frequently refined lighting values, material properties, and input handling based on visual results and instructor feedback. Through the milestones, my approach evolved from focusing on simply making features work to emphasizing code organization, readability, and maintainability, which ultimately led to a more polished and complete 3D scene.
## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computer science helps me reach my goals by providing problem-solving skills and technical foundations that are applicable across many domains, including software development, visualization, and interactive systems. Working with computational graphics and visualizations gave me practical experience with linear algebra, rendering pipelines, shader programming, and real-time scene management, strengthening my understanding of core CS concepts and supporting my future educational endeavors. Professionally, these skills enable me to design visually rich applications, optimize graphics performance, and create interactive 3D environments, which are valuable for careers in software engineering, game development, simulations, or visualization-focused roles.
